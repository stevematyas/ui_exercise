# UI Exercise
A UI exercise for UI engineer applicants at OneMain. 

> Disclaimer: **_Try not to spend more than a few hours on this, but feel free space it out over a couple of days._** We know a work/life balance is important and exercises like this just add on to that.

Please build a solution following the below requirements using a front-end framework of your choice - greatest strength or proficiency - and preferably Angular/React. Note: While arguments may exist allowing plain classic (HTML, JS, CSS) solution to be built, we'd prefer to see you demonstrate how a majority of 0 to 1 solutions that you will deliver to production. 

### Solution requirements: 
- Match the design system, using `design-files` included in this repository, as close as possible. 
- Assume the form submits to a secure backend. 
- All fields are required, though the form changes depending on if payment will be remitted via debit card or bank account.
- Account, routing, and credit card numbers, as well as CVV, should be numbers only.
- CVV should be exactly 3 numbers.
- Routing number should be no more than 9 numbers.
- If any requirements are unclear please document your assumptions and press forward. 
- Please provide instructions to build or run submission unless, submission is already web hosted.

Your response should be a URL to your work in your github repository. Again, please provide instructions to build or run solution unless, solution is already web hosted. 

### What we're looking for
- How close did you get to the design?
- Do all of the validations work?
- Is the user experience simple and intuitive?
- Is the code clean and readable?
- How does the UI behave across different platforms/devices - desktop, mobile, tablet?

If you have any additional questions or need assistance, please reach out as soon as possible.
